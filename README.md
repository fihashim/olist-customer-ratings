# Understanding Olist's Customer Ratings Across Brazilian States
This project builds upon a previous EDA conducted on Olist's ecommerce business found [here](https://github.com/fihashim/olist-eda). Leveraging Google BigQuery and Tableau, the analysis focuses on exploring customer ratings data in more depth to understand variations across different Brazilian states and uncover insights to inform business strategies.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this analysis is to:
- Gain insights into customer satisfaction levels across different regions of Brazil.
- Identify any geographical patterns or disparities in customer ratings.
- Inform marketing and operational strategies to better cater to customer preferences and improve overall satisfaction.
- Explore correlations between customer ratings and other relevant metrics such as product categories and geographical locations.
- Showcase Google Big Query and Tableau dashboard skills.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis is sourced from the same [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) dataset provided, specifically focusing on customer ratings, corresponding geographical information as well as product categories.

## Results

## Future Work
Future iterations of this analysis could involve:

- Incorporating additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis (e.g., competitor analysis).
- Implementing machine learning models for predictive analysis or segmentation based on customer ratings.
- Continuous monitoring of customer ratings and revisiting analysis periodically to track changes and adapt strategies accordingly.
