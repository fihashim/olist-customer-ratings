# Understanding Olist's Customer Ratings Across Brazilian States
This project builds upon a previous EDA conducted on Olist's ecommerce business found [here](https://github.com/fihashim/olist-eda). Leveraging Google BigQuery and Tableau, the analysis focuses on exploring customer ratings data in more depth to understand variations across different Brazilian states and uncover insights to inform business strategies.

The motivation behind this analysis is to:
- Gain insights into customer satisfaction levels across different regions of Brazil.
- Identify any geographical patterns or disparities in customer ratings.
- Inform marketing and operational strategies to better cater to customer preferences and improve overall satisfaction.
- Explore correlations between customer ratings and other relevant metrics such as product categories and geographical locations.
- Showcase Google Big Query and Tableau dashboard skills.

## Data Source
